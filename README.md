# amazon-fee-calculator
The Amazon Fee calculator helps the Sellers to quickly check the profitability of the product at a given price point and helps them to adjust the same to check variations of different parameters.
It is easy to deploy on a WAMP/LAMP or any PHP based server. 
I have created this tool for myself and maybe it can help others as well.
